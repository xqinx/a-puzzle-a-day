# A-Puzzle-A-Day

This is a toy implementation to solve the A-Puzzle-A-Day puzzle from
[dragonfjord](https://www.dragonfjord.com/product/a-puzzle-a-day/)

I mainly use it as an little exercise to practice programming in Rust. There will
definitely be better ways of doing things and probably bugs in the code but it
does solve the puzzle and print out all possible solutions. All comments are
welcome.
